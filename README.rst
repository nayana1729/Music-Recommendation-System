Music Recommendation System
========================================

About this project:
------------------------

This project is a web application that allows the user to upload a song as an mp3 file and recommends the top 5 songs (or as many as provided) that are the most similar based on feature extractions from a folder of songs stored by the user.

How to use:
------------------------

1. Install pandas, numpy, librosa, pydub, flask, sci-kit learn
2. Run "python3 app.py"
3. A folder called songs will be created. Store your mp3 files there to recommend from.

Current Issues:
------------------------

	- Display feature does not provide last two details
	- Search feature only allows you to search by name
